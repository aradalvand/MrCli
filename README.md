# Intro:
Cyrus *(pronounced **sigh-res**)* is a framework for building modern CLI programs with C#.

It uses zero reflection at runtime, instead, Cyrus takes advantage of source generators to create the most optimized flow for your app at runtime, and more importantly, to be AOT-friendly out of the box; so that your program will feel as snappy as possible and respond instantaneously as soon as you hit *Enter*!

## Features:
- ðŸ’Ž Simple, elegant, minimalistic â€” you'll pick it up in an hour, things just _make sense_
- ðŸ”¥ Robust and *fast* argument parser â€” compliant with the de-facto standard [`getopts`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getopts)
- 100% reflection-free â€” Cyrus uses source generators for everything other frameworks use reflection for, it doesn't want to waste absolutely any time on startup!
- ðŸ’‰ Support for dependency injection and .NET's configuration abstractions â€” use the official tried-and-tested libraries
- âš¡ Performant and meticulously optimized â€” being fast is Cyrus's main claim to fame!
- ðŸ’¨ AOT-friendly â€” compile your fully-C# CLI programs to native code, making them as snappy as those written in Go, Rust, etc.
- ðŸ‘Œ Zero dependencies â€” Cyrus is written from scratch, no bloat whatsoever

# Installation:

You can use the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cyrus/):
```shell
dotnet add package Cyrus
```

Alternatively, you can install and then use Cyrus's project template:
```
dotnet new install Cyrus.Template
dotnet new cli
```

Mr. Cli â€” the simple .NET framework for building command-line applications
```csharp
app.MapCommand("restore {projectPath?}", (
    CommandContext ctx,
    string projectPath = ".",
    [StandardInput] string? content = null,
    [Name("foo")] bool shouldHaveFoo,
    [Alias("q")] bool quiet = false,
) =>
{
    return $"Done! {projectPath}";
});
```
